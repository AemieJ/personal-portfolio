In my past week with Outreachy, I had a particular goal of working with the issues related to the website as much as possible and create more firm interaction with mentors. I have taken several issues into account and tried to come up with solutions and design alternatives. A few issues were difficult to solve but with the guidance of mentors and helpers, it felt like an easy ride. 

There was a particular issue that seemed a bit hard to solve and it took days to get a grasp of how the automation worked for the codebase. However, now I am clear with how the generation of code takes place and where the changes are required and continue to make improvements on it along with my mentor. 

My issue concerned with AsciiDoctor files and hence, I spent time reading the documentation and understand its structure. Besides that, I didnâ€™t show any hesitation to ask for help if I was stuck, even if it may seem small to my mentor. The mentors made sure to reply based on their timezones and continued to show help. 

Apart from that, currently, I am organizing an online hackathon, Mind Jam, on devfolio and to properly manage time between outreachy, organizing and college works seemed a tough job initially. However, as days passed, I could adjust to properly manage time among different activities and I continue to work upon it to achieve maximum productivity. I also hope to make worthwhile contributions to Apache and no matter what struggles come, I wish to look at it with a peaceful mind and come up with an appropriate solution to it.
