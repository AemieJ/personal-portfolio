Currently, I am an undergraduate at NIT Surat and phasing into my 3rd year. I love work experiences that are based on the skills I know or don't as in my opinion, any experience is worth a million-dollar opportunity of personal growth. I am currently looking forward to working for internships as I want to grasp maximum knowledge and experience during the lockdown phase and every minute after as well.

To date, I have interned as a software designer intern in a growing startup and as an outreachy intern this year. From the experiences, I love interning for open source projects and companies. Even if I prefer interning for open source dev projects, I am open to working with cooperating companies as my major focus is to learn, grow, and develop.

I am currently a full stack web developer. I am comfortable with the MERN stack and apart from it, within web development, I know the use of Django and firebase as well. Apart from web development, I have familiarity with blockchain tools as well and have a good knowledge of computer vision and CNN. 

I love exploring new concepts and design techniques. I have basic knowledge of docker and dwelling into cloud computing for database management. Thus, my current goal in learning is docker and cloud computing. This are among the topics that I find highly interesting yet very intimidating which creates the urge to learn about it. 

With my experience, not only can I easily cooperate and work with the team, I can show leadership skills as well. I am a good and calm listener and I love to suggest my opinions on a particular decision. I have been the Lead Organizer of a hackathon conducted - Mind Jam and I am currently working collaboratively with my outreachy partner as well for better improvement of the website. 

Apart from the development and technicals skills, I can speak and write English fluently. As an Indian, I can speak and understand Hindi as well. I have had my second higher education in The Millennium School, Dubai where I was certified among the 0.1% top-listed scorers among all the students who attended CBSE in boards for physics. I am studious, I have expanded interest in co-curricular activities as well but love development the most.
