Namaste & As-salamu alaykum! Don’t be so astonished, I am born in Gujarat, India and lived in Dubai, UAE for 10 years. So got to say, respect both cultures and love Arabic. I am 20 years currently and along with being a tech enthusiast, I am a huge fitness freak. I love exercising (Yoga Mainly).

I scored 99 in Physics in boards so puts me in top 0.1 % all over India. Didn’t expect that myself. I love Basketball, throwball, volleyball and athletics. I am a tiny person but I have a lot of energy & enthusiasm. Now let’s talk about my technical abilities. I major in web development as to date but I also know Blockchain, ML, CV and I create chrome extensions and CLI too! I love to connect, so I am putting all the social links down, if you want to do a project sometime or just talk, ping me!
