> A dive into the life of an open-source developer and a major tech enthusiast.

Aemie, an undergrad in NIT, Surat pursuing Computer Engineering and I am an enthusiastic machine learning and blockchain and web developer eager to contribute to team success through hard work, attention to detail, and excellent organizational skills. Motivated to learn, grow, and excel in the growing technical fields. My objective is to work in a professional environment and utilize my skills for the betterment of the company.

If I were to choose 3 major core values about myself, it would include Curiosity, Contribution, and Growth. The explanation for these choices is I am a curious learner and I love to explore my options in various tech stacks. In my progress to explore and learn, I believe in putting this knowledge to contribute to open source for a better experience environment. On Github, I learn not only to push liable commits but also to grow with the developersâ€™ community.

I have always had an interest in making open-source contributions. I am a 2nd year undergraduate in NIT, Surat and I had a goal to contribute to an open-source project and do so actively. For me, outreachy is a learning platform that will help with the strong build-up on my core values. Hence, I made outreachy my priority for the year 2020 and I was all set to make contributions and grow with the community and the mentors.
